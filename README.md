# yanicks-sveltekit-starter

My personal boilerplate starter:

- SvelteKit
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Unplugin icons

Based on https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte

## Installing and running

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
